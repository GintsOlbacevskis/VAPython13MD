### syn.py
The multiprocessing module in Python allows the creation of processes that can run in parallel, utilizing multiple CPU cores. Unlike threads, processes have separate memory space, making them ideal for CPU-intensive tasks or scenarios where true parallelism is required

On Windows, raw sockets require administrator privileges

### Requirements
- pip3 install scapy
- Install Npcap:
    + Install Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode.
    + Support raw 802.11 traffic (and monitor mode).
    + Restrict Npcap driver installation to Administrators only
